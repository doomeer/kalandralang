# Kalandralang

Kalandralang is a DSL (Domain-Specific programming Language) to express crafting
methods for Path of Exile, and an interpreter for this language.
The interpreter runs in the command-line. You give it a recipe source file and it
executes the recipe, showing you the final item and the total ingredient cost.
You can tell Kalandralang to execute the recipe multiple
times to get an idea of the average cost of the recipe. It even shows you
pretty graphs:

## Supported Operating Systems

Kalandralang runs on Linux. It may run on other platform, including Windows, but
no instructions are provided to get it to run on them; you're on your own.
