# This example shows how to use Orbs of Alteration and Orbs of Augmentation
# to obtain +1 to Level of All Skill Gems on an Agate Amulet.
# First, we start from an Agate Amulet with magic rarity.
buy "Metadata/Items/Amulets/Amulet9"
scour
transmute
assert (prefix_count + suffix_count) <= 2

# Then we spam.
until has "GlobalSkillGemLevel1" do {
  if prefix_count = 0 then {
    # No prefix: we use an Orb of Augmentation to get one.
    augment
  }
  else {
    # There is a prefix: use a Orb of Alteration.
    # +1 to Level of All Skill Gems is a prefix, so there is no point
    # in trying to use an Orb of Augmentation.
    alt
  }

  # After using either an Orb of Augmentation or an Orb of Alteration,
  # we check whether the amulet has the mod we want.
  # This is the condition of the "until" instruction: "GlobalSkillGemLevel1"
  # is the identifier for +1 to Level of All Skill Gems.
  # If the item doesn't have the mod, we continue the loop.
}

# And now the current item has +1 to Level of All Skill Gems.
# It may or may not have a suffix too.
